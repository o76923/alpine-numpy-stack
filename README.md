# alpine-numpy-stack

A quick and dirty alpine numpy stack that uses python 3.5 with cython, pandas, openblas, and numexpr. It may not be optimially efficient since it is pulled from non-consecutive sections of another project that I'm working on but enough people might be interested in using it that I've made it available despite not being perfect.
